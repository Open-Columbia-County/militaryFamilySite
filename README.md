# Military Family Website


# PURPOSE:
Imagine your Veteran loved one is suddenly unable to speak for themselves and you find yourself needing information.  But because as with many other Veterans they have taken care of themselves and their information all on their own.  Do you know who to contact?  If they are getting retirement benefits, do you know who to inform in their passing and if you get to continue to get any benefits as a spouse?

Being a Veteran myself I do know who to contact for my Father, and given my Mother was with my father during his active duty time she has a pretty good idea of who to contact as well.  However, my husband was never a Navy spouse.  I receive Disability and I have insurance through the VA, he has no idea who to contact or what he may or may not get in the event of my passing.  That is where the idea of this project came from.

Sure I could have files on the computer or in a cabinet that he can find, but sometimes having a bigger network is better.  So there are a few things that will a part of this project.  Not just a website with a database, but also a network of contacts.

# PROGRESS:
Currently set up as a Django project with the app created but no pages as of yet.  The temp database key is already saved in the env.py file, the final key is removed for safety reasons.

## WHAT IS NEEDED:

1. Main landing page with access to several sites or pages of information
2. Login page
3. Ability to save pages as favorites
4. User Dashboard, must have a form or place to list those who may gain access to the account content
5. Way to determine how to verify that the individual requesting access is on the list.  Should be part of the above form
6. Tawk.to will be the chat service used to assist members - have sign up for volunteers who wish to be a part of that system
7. Search functions to find sites for Veterans.
8. User Dashboard should have area where the user can upload files.  (These can only be accessed by members of the user's account)
9. Possible user levels, Admin, Veteran, Family - Family has access to view their Veterans information, Veteran gives family access.  Admin has Tawk.to and nearly full access to site to assist with family members
